# Follow portfolio movements from participants in the MillionÃ¦rklubben panel

The dl code goes into a cronjob, so e.g. each evening the webpage https://www.home.saxo/da-dk/campaigns/millionaerklubben is scraped.

This project scrapes the Saxo Bank webpage https://www.home.saxo/da-dk/campaigns/millionaerklubben for movements in buys and sells of the participants' portfolios into csv files.
The daily movements are analysed and converted into an gantt chart like overview PNG.
